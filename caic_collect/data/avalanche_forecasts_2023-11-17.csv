Chris Bilbrey,2023-11-16T23:30:00Z,Southern Mountains Regional Forecast,,"Southern Mountains Regional DiscussionOn Thursday, mountain snow showers broke up the steady string of bluebird skies, but did little to change current avalanche conditions. Emerson said…”adopt the pace of nature, her secret is patience”. Backcountry enthusiast hoping for notable change to snow conditions have to wait a tad bit longer. The next shot at meaningful snowfall arrives Saturday afternoon, and places in the San Juan Mountains that do well on southwest flow could see eight or more inches of total snow by Sunday. If this scenario plays out, the avalanche danger could rise to Moderate (2of5) above treeline on slopes where weak, early-season snow lingers.So far this season, we have no reports of avalanche activity in the Southern Mountains. Limited snow cover coincides with little avalanche hazard. Areas near Red Mountain Pass, in the Sneffels Range, and near Ophir have received more snow than areas south of Silverton along US 550, in the La Plata Mountains, near Wolf Creek Pass, and Sangre de Cristo Range. Even in the deepest snowfall areas, the snowpack is thin and discontinuous even on shady slopes. Sunny slopes have mostly melted to bare ground.If you were to find a slope with continuous snow cover, an avalanche you trigger would likely be small. Places that harbor wind-drifted snow over weak, faceted snow may exist on high-elevation, northerly aspects. Weather hiking, hunting, or in search of early-season turns, use caution in steeper terrain where even a small avalanche can lead to a rough, nasty ride over shallowly-buried obstacles.Remember, what snow persist on slopes is rapidly losing cohesion and becoming a weak layer of the future. As we prepare for a change to more wintry weather, noting where the snow has collected and what slopes are bare ground will help you stay ahead of the avalanche curve once winter arrives and the snowpack gains depth. Until then, burn a pair of old skis for Ullr or wash your vehicle to help make it snow.",No rating
Andrew McWilliams,2023-11-16T23:30:00Z,Northern Mountains Regional Discussion,,"Northern Mountains Regional DiscussionWith an additional few inches of snowfall and continued wind forecast for Thursday night we kept the danger elevated for the Park Range on Friday. Elsewhere in the North, the danger remains LOW (Level 1 of 5).On high-elevation northerly and some east-facing slopes, weak, faceted snow is still left from October and early November storms. In some places, there are thin slabs of denser, drifted snow above the weak, faceted snow. Whether the surface is soft or hard, the snowpack structure is poor. New snow is drifting and forming slabs that are resting on this poorly structured snowpack. This combination is a recipe for avalanches. You are most likely to trigger an avalanche where October weak layers got buried on Thursday. Thankfully, the weak, old snow is not continuous across the slope. While this should keep the avalanche size small, keep in mind that any ride in an avalanche will likely result in being carried over rocks or other obstacles at this time.The weather breaks on Friday as the next storm starts to make its way to our area Saturday night. No additional precipitation is expected Friday and the danger may briefly go back down to LOW (Level 1 of 5) in the Park Range on Saturday. Any drop in danger will be short-lived as the next system begins to affect the Northern Mountains beginning Saturday night though Monday. Look for favored areas to split off of the large Northern and Central Mountains zone for Sunday and the danger to increase. Many southerly-facing slopes melted back to bare ground in the Northern Mountains during the recent warm and sunny weather. Look to these slopes for safer riding as they get buried over the weekend.",No rating
Dylan Craaybeek,2023-11-16T23:30:00Z,Central Mountains Regional Discussion,,"Central Mountains Regional DiscussionSome long-awaited snow arrived in the Central Mountains on Thursday, although it wasn’t much. The highest portions of the Grand Mesa and Frying Pan as well as portions of the Sawatch saw up to one or two inches of snow while portions of the Elk and West Elk Mountains picked up about two to four inches of snow. Accompanied by some strong west-to-southwest winds, Thursday's storm did little to change the avalanche danger as not enough snow fell to develop any sort of slab aside from some isolated, wind-loaded terrain features. By avoiding traveling on the lee sides of ridgelines at the top of the slope or in cross-loaded gullies and couloirs, or any other typical wind-loaded terrain features, you can drastically reduce your chances of triggering an avalanche. Any avalanche you trigger will likely be small but they can still take you for a rocky, dangerous ride and entrain any old snow from October growing slightly bigger than you might expect.Tomorrow will be another dry November day across the Central Mountains but this weekend our next storm arrives. Snowfall should start across most of the region on Saturday, increasing in intensity on Sunday. By Monday, favored areas in the West Elks, Elks, and Grand Mesa may see over a foot of total snow. Once we reach about 10 to 12 inches of snow you will see the avalanche danger increase quickly. There is a well-developed weak layer from our October snow storms on most northwest, north, and northeast slopes as well as some high-elevation east and southeast-facing slopes. Once enough snow falls to create a slab on this weak layer you can expect it to be very easy to trigger avalanches on any slopes that had continuous snow coverage prior to Thursday’s snowfall. It is far too early to tell what the winter season will bring, but we know once we get enough snow to develop a slab it will bring several days to several weeks of heightened to dangerous avalanche conditions across a great deal of the Central Mountains.",No rating

Dylan Craaybeek,2023-11-16T23:30:00Z,Northern and Central Mountains,"Generally safe avalanche conditions exist. The few areas where you may be able to trigger an avalanche are where about one to three inches of new snow from Thursday, accompanied by strong westerly winds, created thin, cohesive slabs of snow on top of weak October snow. Identify and avoid wind-loaded slopes to reduce your chances of triggering a small but potentially dangerous avalanche. You are most likely to encounter these wind-loaded slopes on the lee sides of a ridgeline or in a northerly or easterly-facing gully or couloir where the snow has a hard, hollow feel to it.",,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1
Andrew McWilliams,2023-11-16T23:30:00Z,Park Range,"New snow on Thursday and continuing wind will keep the avalanche danger elevated above treeline in the Park Range on Friday. You can trigger an avalanche where you find recently drifted snow resting on weak, old snow from October. You are most likely to find this combination on north, northeast, and east-facing slopes, especially just below ridgelines and in gullies. Any avalanche you trigger should be small, but could take you for a ride over exposed rocks.",,moderate,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0
Chris Bilbrey,2023-11-16T23:30:00Z,Southern Mountains,"Limited snow cover means there are very few places where you can trigger an avalanche. If you find hard, wind-drifted snow on high-elevation northerly-facing slopes, there is a slim chance you might trigger a small avalanche. Use caution traveling in steep gullies and areas close to ridgelines where going for a ride in a small slide with such shallow snow cover can be dangerous.",,high,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1
